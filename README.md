This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the course Project for CSC 410-Web Programming of University of Rochester in Fall 2018</br>

The front end is designed based on <b>react</b> and <b>reactstrap & bootstrap</b> and some other UI components libraries.</br>
  
  Server side controller is established based on <b>Express</b>, a JavaScript server library, to construct multiple router to get requeset and send data with client.</br>

  Also manipulate data via <b>MongoDB</b>, connect it to server controller with usage of <b><mongoose</b>, a mongoDB  JavaScript driver.


  The website we build is a badminton game registration webpage, use could register here and use their email&password to log in to see their game history</br>
  
  There are three <b>live boards</b> on our page, from which all users could see the score of games that are playing.</br>
  
  After registering, as we get user's address, we use the <b>Google Map</b> API and react mark component to show the <b>rountine</b> from user's home to game station, which help user to find right place.
